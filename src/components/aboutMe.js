                Outside of work, I love playing and watching sports, with football holding a special place in my heart. 
                As a die-hard Manchester United fan, I've had my fair share of highs and lowsâ€”more lows recently, but I'm loyal to the end! 
                One of my most memorable experiences was definitely visiting Old Trafford and watching a match live last November.        
                <br /><br />
                I also love exploring new places, experiencing different cultures, and finding inspiration in the world around me. 
                These experiences fuel my creativity and bring balance to my life.
