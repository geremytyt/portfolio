                I am a fresh graduate software engineer with a passion in
                full-stack development. I am excited to embrace new challenges
                and contribute to innovative solutions in the tech industry.

                Throughout my life, I've learned the importance of setting personal goals and focusing on consistent progress rather than comparing myself to others. I believe that growth is a personal journey, and success comes from embracing challenges at your own pace. This mindset has helped me stay motivated, whether in college, exploring new technologies, or navigating life outside of work. I strive to create a balance between ambition and self-compassion, constantly reminding myself that every step forward, no matter how small, is a step toward achieving my dreams.

                Outside of work, I love playing and watching sports, with football
                holding a special place in my heart. As a die-hard Manchester
                United fan, I've had my fair share of highs and lowsâ€”more lows
                recently, but I'm loyal to the end! One of my most memorable
                experiences was definitely visiting Old Trafford and watching a
                match live last November.

                I also love exploring new places, experiencing different cultures,
                and finding inspiration in the world around me. These experiences
                fuel my creativity and bring balance to my life.
